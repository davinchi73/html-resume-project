  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Devinn Chi and I am a student at Macalester College. I am currently a semester away from achieving a 
    Bachelor's degree with a major in computer science and a minor in data science. I am also an NCAA Division III diver 
    on the Macalester menâ€™s swim & dive team! Much of my relevant coursework includes software development, machine 
    learning, AI & robotics, among other classes. 
  </p>

  <p>When it comes to work, my experiences related to computer science are: my participation in the prestigious NSF-REU
     program at the University of Minnesota, computer science tutoring at Macalester College, and two years as a computer
     sales advisor at Best Buy. To speak more on my most relevant experience, that being the NSF-REU program, the research 
     project that I worked on was a proof of concept product that we aimed at reducing overdose. My partner and I conducted 
     research that allowed us to synthesize and perform testing on a deployable system that would use a thermal camera to 
     detect breathing patterns on passengers of a light-rail train, and if breathing stops (due to detected overdose), a user 
     interface would display location of the person at risk, dispense naloxone (a life-saving overdose prevention medication), 
     and provide instructions for administration of the naloxone. Our ultimate goal was to provide groundwork for future 
     research in this area, and to hopefully help prevent opioid overdose in high-risk spaces where bystanders can be utilized
     as first responders.</p>

  <p>My other experience includes school coursework which has helped me build proficiency in Python using VSCode, and other
     languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JS, and even the low level language C. Through my coursework I have completed a 
     number of projects, including multiple GUI games, a user interface AVL/Black and Red binary tree visual tool, an online 
     task management web tool, an AI/LLM-powered EV3 robot companion software, and more! These projects and courses display my 
     aptitude and enthusiasm towards programming, and highlight my strength in speedy learning. As I search for more opportunities 
     for professional experience, I believe that an opportunity to work in teams with qualified professionals is the perfect 
     opportunity to kickstart my career!</p>
